# PCB Development in KiCAD
For this semester, we will be creating custom PCBs (printed circuit boards) in a free software called [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/download/), primarily for the use of condensing space inside the avionics bay and to move the club further towards the goal of a space shot in which custom PCBs would be critical to the development of avionics. Before we decide on a final design, in order to easily share and access the schematics, we will be using GitHub as a form of version control. Notably, before we get into the actual logistics of GitHub itself, I wanted to create a comprehensive list _(as of 2/5/26)_ of the parts that we will be using

| Coloquial Name  | Name |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Microcontroller  | ESP32-S3  |
| Battery | LiPO  |
| Barometer | MS561101BA03-50 |
| IMU | LSM6DSO32TR |
| MOSFET| TBD |
| Resistor| Generic for now |
| Capacitor | Also Generic |

There should be a ZIP file included to help for some of the imports, if you cannot find a specific item you are looking for, please reach out to Loring. Also note the current PCBs on the main branch of KiCAD are primarily for demonstration and by no means are the current version of what we are making. 

# Forking and GitHub
Since I am the owner of this repository, I cannot demonstrate how to fork a repository but I can link you to the GitHub Page about this--click [here]([url](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)) to read how before adding your own commits. This ensure that everyone can keep version control of their PCB without effecting the current main PCB. If you have any issues with Forking this repository (make sure it is the KiCAD branch), please reach out! Also want to note unlike when it come to coding development, it is significantly easier to manage uploading files and pushes using the online GitHub website rather than the desktop.
