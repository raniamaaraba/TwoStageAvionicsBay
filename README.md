# HardyDarty
A project developed by the University of Cincinnati Rocketry Club to create a Boosted Dart with capabilities reaching Mach 1 as a lead-up to a full dual-deployment rocket. Our Avionics team was tasked with creating a custom electronics bay from choosing the parts to the 3D printed bay. This README is a synopsis of our coding, wiring, CAD, and final launch process leading to our launch on November 23rd, 2025 at the WSR club in Dayton.

# Final Launch

Harty Darty reached apogee at 9,241ft, reaching Mach 1.03 with 27 Gs of force. Great turnout for the entire project and all those who participated! Team lead by Project Manager [Sam Theil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-theil/), Avionics Lead [Jesse Dominguez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdz29/), and Structures Lead [Evan Langenderfer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evan-langenderfer/).

# Goals
Create a fully functional avionics bay within scope, with primary features including data logging, apogee detection, reading sensors and continuity, as well as working with pyrotechnics. 
## High Priority Items


| Logging | Goals |
| --- | --- |
| Current Location | Be able to understand where the rocket is in terms of position, on the pad, in flight, or has landed; using barometric pressure |
| Current Stage | Determine 1st stage burn, 2nd coasting, and final descent|
| Pyro channel continuity | Continuous checks to ensure activity |
| Motor Burn Status | General statistic |
| Parachute Deployment | General statistic but also great for confirming deployment in logs |
| Errors | Anything that goes wrong during flight can be logged to be fixed and improved upon |
| Battery Voltage | Ensuring that data is being read properly and is not due to dying voltage |

**Other Goals**
| Goal | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Mach Transition Time | A critical mission for this boosted-dart was achieving Mach 1 capabilities so tests for continuity was critical in development |
| Trigger Messages | When a change occurs in anything we deemed loggable (or Mach 1), record to the outputted txt or cvg file |
| Safety and Abort Systems | With safetey always being at the forefront, if there was something critically wrong the system should abort |
| Online Transferable logging information | With our ESP, we could host a Wi-Fi connection and connect to the local host to download the recorded data after flight|


Primary Code Development was [Loring Teuteuberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loring-teuteberg/),[Rania Maaraba](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rania-maaraba-403987290/), and [Jesse Dominguez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdz29/). CAD development was handled by Jonah Ulcer and Jesse Dominguez at Design Fusion, Cincinnati Ohio. Wiring development and non-custom avionics utilising the Blue Raven by Featherweight Altimiters, created by Hayden Mays. Final Code pushed in _'development'_ branch.

Courtesy of Hayden Mays, this was the wiring developed for Harty Darty's custom avionics bay. Wiring was later executed by Loring Teuteuberg.

### Packages
Developed in C++ using PlatformIO in VSC with Adafruit LSM6DS, barometer MS5611 SPI on a Seeed ESP32S3.
